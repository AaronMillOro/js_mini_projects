# Library project

This app is based on book objects that are going to be stored in an array that can take user’s input triggered by and 'Add button'. 

The book objects should have the book’s **title**, **author**, the **number of pages**, and whether or not you have **read** the book.

Each book element contains two buttons, one  that removes the book from the library and the other that chnages the status 'read/unread'.
